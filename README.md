# 2018 Workshops

This project folder includes the projects I've worked on throughout 2018. It's comprised mainly of projects directly related to my education in Computer Software Engineering Technology at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, but may also include side projects that I've done on my own in pursuit of learning or sharpening existing skills.
