        <h2 class="hline2"> Closing Price Over Time
        </h2>
        <p class="para-content"> For this first visualization, I collated the closing price of five different stock symbols on a quarterly basis over the course of the last eight years. As referenced by the chart, all of the commodities have been rolling through an upwards-trend. Nvidia (NVDA), visualized by the orange line, can be seen with an extreme rise following an event in 2016. Further rises in the share valuation can be contributed to the unveiling of cutting-edge graphics technology. Care should be taken despite Nvidia's impressive growth, as market volatility can cause trouble for investors looking for fast payouts.

        </h2>
        <p class="para-content"> For the second visualization, I decided to focus more on the 2018 numbers. The percentage of variance over the course of the year is a critical facet to deciding on a commodity to invest in. Contrary to the first visualization, Microsoft displays a steady and unmatched increase since the year open.

        </h2>
        <p class="para-content"> Based on the information I gathered and analyzed, it would seem that Microsoft (MSFT) is the safest bet as an investment. The overarching stock price over the last eight years, combined with the 2018 YTD variance, shows that it is the most stable and consistently-bullish commodity out of the five chosen to appear on my charts.
