        <p class="para-content"> For this first visualization, I collated the closing price of five different stock symbols on a quarterly basis over the course of the last eight years. As referenced by the chart, all of the commodities have been rolling through an upwards-trend. Nvidia (NVDA), visualized by the orange line, can be seen with an extreme rise following an event in 2016. Further rises in the share valuation can be contributed to the unveiling of cutting-edge graphics technology. Care should be taken despite Nvidia's impressive growth, as market volatility can cause trouble for investors looking for fast payouts.
