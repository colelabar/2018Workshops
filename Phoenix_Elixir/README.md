# Elixir / Phoenix
==================

These projects are being built alongside my reading of  [Programming Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix), by Chris McCord, Bruce Tate, and Jos√© Valim.

Learning Elixir, and its framework Phoenix, is a really interesting experience that I believe will help me advance my career as an application and web developer! These two projects are just simple play-arounds of Elixir and Phoenix, with the "rumbl" being a sort of app allowing posts to a main feed. A more fleshed out and personalized version of this project is found in [my Elixir/Phoenix project](https://github.com/colelabar/elixir-short-story).
