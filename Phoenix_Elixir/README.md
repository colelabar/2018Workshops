# Elixir / Phoenix
==================

These projects are being built alongside my reading of  [Programming Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix), by Chris McCord, Bruce Tate, and Jos√© Valim.

Learning Elixir, and its framework Phoenix, is a really interesting experience that I believe will help me advance my career as an application and web developer!
